# Reality Monitoring

__Ref__: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S014976342200046X>

## Highlights

- Overlap between imagination and perception complicates perceptual reality monitoring (PRM).
- Imagined signals seem more controlled and less vivid than reality.
- But no single factor unambiguously dissociates internal from external signals.
- PRM might be implemented by higher-order circuit evaluating sensory and cognitive factors.
- This hierarchical architecture might share computations with meta-cognition.
