# Teaching: Reducing Teacher Talking Time

## Experience with Talking in class

- Silence or pick one, if no one  is saying, I'm going to do it.
- Use of reactions
- being okay with silence
- mixed activities
- asking questions to students directly

### Ideas

1. **Student-Led Discussions**: Encourage student-led discussions where they share their thoughts, fostering an interactive environment.

2. **Group Work**: Use group activities to distribute speaking opportunities, making interactions more dynamic and reducing teacher-centered talk.

3. **Think-Pair-Share Technique**: Implement this method for individual thinking followed by partner discussion before a whole-class sharing session.

4. **Technology Integration**: Utilize tools like interactive whiteboards or online platforms for students to present work, minimizing teacher-led explanations.

5. **Differentiated Instruction**: Allow advanced students to lead discussions or explain concepts to peers, utilizing their time effectively.

6. **Encourage Reflection**: Assign reflection tasks where students write down what they learned or questions they have, providing verbal space outside class.

7. **Visual Aids**: Use charts, diagrams, or infographics to clarify content, reducing the need for extensive verbal instruction.

8. **Pre-Provided Materials**: Give handouts or worksheets upfront so students can focus on listening and interacting rather than taking notes.

9. **Pacing Lessons**: Keep lessons concise to limit detailed verbal explanations, ensuring efficient coverage of material.

10. **Growth Mindset**: Foster a classroom culture where students see the teacher as a facilitator of ideas, encouraging participation without pressure.
