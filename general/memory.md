# How memory works

__Ref__: <https://nautil.us/what-makes-a-memory-real-787268/>

## Highlights

- __Memory__ uses the same brain machinery as other thoughts and perceptions.
- [[reality-monitoring]]: The mental process of distinguishing between memories of real events and those that were imagined.
- __Perception vs. Imagination__:
  - __Perception__: Visual information flows from the eyes through the visual cortex to higher-order brain areas for recognition.
  - __Imagination__: The process begins in higher-order brain areas, with additional involvement of the __frontal cortex__, which helps with cognitive control.
- __Anterior Medial Prefrontal Cortex__: This region is crucial for distinguishing real memories from imagined ones, playing a key role in attention, working memory, and long-term memory.
- > We rely on our memory to understand the reality we live in.
