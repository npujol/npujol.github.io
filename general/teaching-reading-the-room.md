# Teaching: Reading the room: Adapting Teaching in Action

## Notes

### Delivery & Adapt

Challenging Dynamics & Strategies to break them

- bring you out to the main object
- that depends of the group
- each group has his own dynamics and you have to be flexible and adapt to they

1. Lack of attention: group works, alternate the type of activity, games, asking them why is interesting for the Thema, recognize the difficult topics, get feedback in all stages of the course.
2. Conflict in the room: split the group, express the emotions, calm the group, draw the conflict, give the space to speak about what is happening, not ignore, give space, move to a another mindset or physical state.
3. Technology takes over: brainstorm, games, break or mix the group, simplify the content
4. Missing participants.
5. Content no landing: ask about the content or repeat the content, help from the co-facilitator, short break, explain  the content in one line, should be clear why is important what they are leaning, visualization, step back.
6. Different levels of knowledge: every group has those situations, democratic dynamics, asking questions, use your co-teacher, pair the kids(support others), beginning and end dynamics no related to the content.

The power of co-facilitation (someone has my back)

### Co-facilitation

- intentional act to work together
- the 3 R's of co-facilitation: Roles(who is doing what?)->Rituals(What are our anchors?)->Risk(What could go wrong?)

Roles:

- Which are the Roles that we should have?
- Which are the requirements of each Role?
- Should be set the tasks for each Role forehand?

Rituals:

- Should we have a specific ritual at the beginning and at the end of each class?
- Should we have a small talk in each break or before each independent group exercise?

Risks:

- Should we have a feedback after each class?
