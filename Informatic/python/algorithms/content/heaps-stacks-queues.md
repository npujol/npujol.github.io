## Heaps Stacks and Queues

__Stacks:__ Operations are performed LIFO (last in, first out), which means that the last element added will be the first one removed. A stack can be implemented using an array or a linked list. If the stack runs out of memory, itâ€™s called a stack overflow.

__Queue:__ Operations are performed FIFO (first in, first out), which means that the first element added will be the first one removed. A queue can be implemented using an array.

__Heap:__ A tree-based data structure in which the value of a parent node is ordered in a certain way with respect to the value of its child node(s). A heap can be either a min heap (the value of a parent node is less than or equal to the value of its children) or a max heap (the value of a parent node is greater than or equal to the value of its children).
