## Synchronous Frameworks

Synchronous frameworks in python handle the flow of data in a synchronous manner. On a s̲y̲n̲c̲h̲r̲o̲n̲o̲u̲s̲ request, you make the request and stop executing your program until you get a response from the HTTP server (or an error if the server can’t be reached, or a timeout if the sever is taking way, way too long to reply) The interpreter is blocked until the request is completed (until you got a definitive answer of what happened with the request: did it go well? was there an error? a timeout?… ).
