## Traces

Tracing in Kubernetes involves monitoring the flow of requests through different components of the system, using tools such as Jaeger or Zipkin. OpenTracing and OpenCensus provide a consistent way of capturing traces across different components and applications running on the cluster. Tracing helps identify performance bottlenecks, debug issues, and optimize the system for better performance and scalability. By monitoring traces in Kubernetes, administrators can identify issues and take corrective actions to ensure efficient system performance.
