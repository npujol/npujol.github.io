## Network Security

Network security in Kubernetes involves securing network communication between different components within the cluster and with external networks. This can be achieved through various mechanisms such as __Network Policies__, __Encryption__, __Authentication__, __Authorization__, and __Firewall__ rules. Network Policies provide fine-grained control over network traffic, while encryption ensures secure communication between pods, nodes, and external systems. Authentication and Authorization mechanisms prevent unauthorized access and provide secure communication between various components. Firewall rules help to protect the cluster against external attacks by limiting access to specific ports and protocols. Overall, network security in Kubernetes is critical to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the cluster.
