## Container and Pod Security

Kubernetes (k8s) can secure containers and pods through measures like using trusted container images, limiting container privileges, enforcing pod-level security policies, implementing network security measures, using access controls with __RBAC__, and managing sensitive information with __Secrets__ and __ConfigMaps__. These practices help organizations reduce the risk of security incidents in their k8s clusters.
