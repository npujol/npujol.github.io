## Monitoring and Logging

__Monitoring__ in k8s involves keeping an eye on the __health and performance of the cluster__ and its components. This includes monitoring the __usage and availability of resources__ such as CPU, memory, and storage, as well as the status of the k8s services and nodes. Some popular monitoring solutions for k8s include __Prometheus__, __Grafana__, and __Datadog__.

Logging in k8s involves collecting and analyzing the logs generated by the various components in the cluster, such as the applications, pods, and nodes. These logs can provide insights into the behavior and performance of the cluster, and can also help with troubleshooting issues. Some popular logging solutions for k8s include __Fluentd__, __Elasticsearch__, and __Kibana__.
