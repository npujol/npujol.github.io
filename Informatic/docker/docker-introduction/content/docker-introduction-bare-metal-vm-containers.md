## Bare Metal vs VM vs Containers

Here is a quick overview of the differences between bare metal, virtual machines, and containers.

## Bare Metal

Bare metal is a term used to describe a computer that is running directly on the hardware without any virtualization. This is the most performant way to run an application, but it is also the least flexible. You can only run one application per server, and you cannot easily move the application to another server.

## Virtual Machines

Virtual machines (VMs) are a way to run multiple applications on a single server. Each VM runs on top of a hypervisor, which is a piece of software that emulates the hardware of a computer. The hypervisor allows you to run multiple operating systems on a single server, and it also provides isolation between applications running on different VMs.

## Containers

Containers are a way to run multiple applications on a single server without the overhead of a hypervisor. Each container runs on top of a container engine, which is a piece of software that emulates the operating system of a computer. The container engine allows you to run multiple applications on a single server, and it also provides isolation between applications running on different containers.

### Comparison between Bare Metal, VMs, and Containers

| __Category__           | __Bare Metal__                             | __Virtual Machines (VMs)__                     | __Containers__                                  |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| __Definition__          | Physical server with no virtualization     | Software emulation of physical hardware        | Lightweight virtualization at the OS level     |
| __Resource Isolation__  | Full dedicated hardware                    | Virtualization layer isolates resources        | Process-level isolation sharing the host OS    |
| __Performance__         | High performance, no overhead              | Some overhead due to hypervisor                | Near-native performance, minimal overhead      |
| __Startup Time__        | Long (requires OS boot)                    | Medium (boots OS within VM)                    | Fast (starts in milliseconds)                  |
| __Resource Utilization__| Less efficient (idle resources)            | More efficient (can oversubscribe resources)   | Highly efficient, sharing kernel and resources |
| __Flexibility__         | Limited to hardware                        | More flexible (multiple OSes on one host)      | Most flexible (runs isolated processes)        |
| __Portability__         | Limited to physical server                 | Moderately portable (requires hypervisor)      | Highly portable (container images)             |
| __Scalability__         | Low, scaling requires physical hardware    | Moderate, scaling with additional VMs          | High, easy to scale by spinning new containers |
| __Security__            | Physical isolation, high security          | Isolated, but vulnerable to hypervisor attacks | Process-level isolation, less secure than VMs  |
| __Management Complexity__ | High, manual server management            | Moderate, requires VM management tools         | Low, automated with container orchestration    |
| __Use Cases__           | High-performance computing, databases      | Running different OS environments, legacy apps | Microservices, cloud-native apps, CI/CD        |
| __Cost__                | High (physical infrastructure and maintenance) | Medium (infrastructure + hypervisor license)   | Low (better resource sharing, minimal overhead)|

### Advantages and Disadvantages of each Category
