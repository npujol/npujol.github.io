## Docker Engine

There is often confusion between “Docker Desktop” and “Docker Engine”. Docker Engine refers specifically to a subset of the Docker Desktop components which are free and open source and can be installed only on Linux.

Docker Engine includes:

* Docker Command Line Interface (CLI)
* Docker daemon (dockerd), exposing the Docker Application Programming Interface (API)

Docker Engine can build container images, run containers from them, and generally do most things that Docker Desktop can, but it is Linux only and doesn’t provide all of the developer experience polish that Docker Desktop provides.
