## Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop is an easy-to-install application that enables developers to quickly set up a Docker environment on their desktop machines. It is available for both Windows and macOS operating systems. Docker Desktop is designed to simplify the process of managing and running Docker containers, providing a user-friendly interface and seamless integration with the host operating system.

### Features
