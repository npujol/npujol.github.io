## Nomad: Deploying Containers

Nomad is a cluster manager and scheduler that enables you to deploy, manage and scale your containerized applications. It automatically handles node failures, resource allocation, and container orchestration. Nomad supports running Docker containers as well as other container runtimes and non-containerized applications.

To dive deeper into Nomad, check out the [official documentation](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs).
