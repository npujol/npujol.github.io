## Go Scheduler

Go Scheduler allows us to understand more deeply about how Golang works internally. In terms of logical processors, cores, threads, pool cache, context switching etc. The Go scheduler is part of the Go runtime, and the Go runtime is built into your application

### Best Practices for Implementing a Scheduler in Go

Implementing a scheduler in Go can be essential for running tasks at specific intervals, handling background jobs, or orchestrating complex workflows. The following best practices will help you create efficient and reliable schedulers in Go:

- __Use the `time` package__ for simple scheduling tasks.
- __Run tasks in separate goroutines__ to prevent blocking the scheduler.
- __Consider a job queue__ or third-party libraries for complex scheduling needs.
- __Handle errors within tasks__ and decide on retry strategies.
- __Use `context.Context`__ to manage timeouts and cancellations.
- __Limit concurrency__ to prevent resource exhaustion.
- __Prioritize tasks__ if certain jobs are more critical.
- __Implement graceful shutdowns__ to clean up resources and finish tasks safely.
- __Test thoroughly__ and monitor the scheduler's performance in production.

#### 1. __Use the `time` Package for Simple Scheduling__

- __Use `time.Ticker` for Repeated Intervals__: For tasks that need to run at regular intervals, use `time.Ticker`. This provides a channel that sends the current time at specified intervals, making it easy to trigger tasks.

__Example__:

```go
ticker := time.NewTicker(1 * time.Minute)
defer ticker.Stop()

for {
    select {
    case <-ticker.C:
        // Execute scheduled task
    }
}
```

- __Use `time.AfterFunc` for Delayed Execution__: For tasks that need to run once after a delay, `time.AfterFunc` can be a simple and effective solution.

__Example__:

```go
time.AfterFunc(10*time.Second, func() {
    // Execute delayed task
})
```

#### 2. __Leverage Goroutines for Concurrency__

- __Run Tasks in Separate Goroutines__: When scheduling tasks, run them in separate goroutines to avoid blocking the scheduler. This ensures that the scheduler can continue to schedule and manage other tasks.

__Example__:

```go
ticker := time.NewTicker(1 * time.Second)
defer ticker.Stop()

for {
    select {
    case <-ticker.C:
        go func() {
            // Execute task in a goroutine
        }()
    }
}
```

#### 3. __Consider Using a Job Queue__

- __Use a Job Queue for Complex Schedules__: For more complex scheduling requirements, such as managing a large number of tasks with different intervals, consider using a job queue. You can implement this by combining channels and goroutines.

__Example__:

```go
type Job func()

func startScheduler(jobs <-chan Job, done chan struct{}) {
    for {
        select {
        case job := <-jobs:
            go job()
        case <-done:
            return
        }
    }
}
```

#### 4. __Use a Scheduler Library for Advanced Scheduling__

- __Consider Third-Party Libraries__: If your scheduling needs are complex (e.g., cron-like scheduling), consider using a well-maintained third-party library like `robfig/cron`. This library supports cron-style scheduling and provides a more powerful framework for task scheduling.

__Example__:

```go
import "github.com/robfig/cron/v3"

c := cron.New()
c.AddFunc("@every 1h", func() { 
    // Execute hourly task 
})
c.Start()
defer c.Stop()
```

#### 5. __Handle Errors Gracefully__

- __Error Handling in Tasks__: Ensure that your scheduled tasks handle errors gracefully. Log errors and decide how to proceed—whether to retry, skip, or abort the task. This prevents the scheduler from failing silently.

__Example__:

```go
go func() {
    err := performTask()
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("Task failed: %v", err)
        // Retry logic or other handling
    }
}()
```

#### 6. __Use Context for Cancellation and Timeouts__

- __Use `context.Context` for Control__: When running long-running or potentially blocking tasks, use `context.Context` to control timeouts and cancellations. This allows you to stop tasks gracefully when needed.

__Example__:

```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
defer cancel()

go func() {
    if err := taskWithContext(ctx); err != nil {
        log.Printf("Task failed: %v", err)
    }
}()
```

#### 7. __Monitor and Limit Concurrency__

- __Limit Concurrent Tasks__: If your scheduler runs many tasks concurrently, ensure you limit the number of concurrent tasks to avoid overwhelming the system. You can use a semaphore pattern to control concurrency.

__Example__:

```go
var sem = make(chan struct{}, 10) // Limit to 10 concurrent tasks

go func() {
    sem <- struct{}{} // Acquire semaphore
    defer func() { <-sem }() // Release semaphore

    performTask()
}()
```

#### 8. __Implement Task Prioritization if Needed__

- __Prioritize Tasks__: If some tasks are more critical than others, implement a priority queue to ensure high-priority tasks are executed before lower-priority ones.

__Example__:

```go
type Job struct {
    Priority int
    Task     func()
}

jobQueue := PriorityQueue{}

func startPriorityScheduler(jobs <-chan Job) {
    for job := range jobs {
        go job.Task()
    }
}
```

#### 9. __Graceful Shutdown and Resource Cleanup__

- __Handle Shutdown Gracefully__: Ensure your scheduler can shut down gracefully, finishing or safely stopping any running tasks and releasing resources. Use a signal channel to handle termination signals.

__Example__:

```go
done := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
signal.Notify(done, os.Interrupt, syscall.SIGTERM)

go func() {
    <-done
    // Perform shutdown tasks
}()
```

#### 10. __Testing and Debugging__

- __Test Scheduler Logic__: Test your scheduler under different conditions, including high load and edge cases. Use Go’s testing tools to create unit tests that simulate the scheduler’s operation.

- __Logging and Monitoring__: Implement logging to track scheduled tasks, their execution times, and any errors that occur. Monitoring tools can also help you understand the scheduler's performance in a production environment.

__Example__:

```go
log.Printf("Task started at %v", time.Now())
```
