__Roadmap info from [roadmap website](https://roadmap.sh/golang/communication)__

Here’s a comparison of __Melody__ and __Centrifugo__ in a markdown table:

| Feature               | __Melody__                                           | __Centrifugo__                                     |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| __Purpose__            | WebSocket framework for handling connections and messages | Scalable real-time messaging server for WebSockets, HTTP, and other protocols |
| __Architecture__       | Simple, library-based approach, runs inside your Go app | Standalone server that integrates with your backend |
| __Use Case__           | Suitable for small to medium real-time WebSocket applications | Ideal for high-scale real-time applications and broadcasting |
| __Scaling__            | Requires manual scaling or external solutions | Built-in horizontal scaling with Redis or NATS for pub/sub |
| __Protocol Support__   | WebSocket only                                       | WebSocket, HTTP-streaming, SSE, GRPC               |
| __Persistence__        | Does not provide built-in persistence                | Built-in support for persistence with Redis        |
| __Authentication__     | Simple, needs to be implemented in your app          | Provides JWT-based authentication and API support  |
| __Load Balancing__     | Needs manual setup for load balancing                | Automatic load balancing with Redis or NATS        |
| __Message Delivery__   | Manages connections and messaging in your app logic  | Guarantees message delivery with pub/sub mechanisms|
| __Client Support__     | Focus on Go-based WebSocket servers                  | Multiple clients: Web, Mobile, GRPC, etc.          |
| __Documentation__      | Lightweight and straightforward                      | More extensive due to its larger scope             |
| __Community/Support__  | Smaller, more niche                                  | Larger, with more enterprise-level use cases       |
| __Built-in Features__  | Lightweight WebSocket management, connection handling | More comprehensive: channels, presence, history, etc. |

### Summary

- __Melody__ is a lightweight WebSocket library that integrates directly into Go applications. It is best for projects that need basic WebSocket support without additional layers of complexity.
- __Centrifugo__ is a more feature-rich, scalable real-time messaging server, which supports multiple protocols and is ideal for larger applications that require distributed systems and high concurrency.

Here are example use cases for both __Melody__ and __Centrifugo__:

### __When to Choose Melody vs Centrifugo__

- Use __Melody__ when:
  - You need simple WebSocket support in a Go application.
  - You don’t require horizontal scaling or external pub/sub services.
  - The use case involves a small or medium-sized project with fewer concurrent users.

- Use __Centrifugo__ when:
  - You require high scalability, fault tolerance, and horizontal scaling.
  - You need features like channel history, presence, and built-in pub/sub systems.
  - The project involves large-scale real-time messaging (e.g., live dashboards, games, social networks).
