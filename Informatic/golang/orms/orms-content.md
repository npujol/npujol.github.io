__Roadmap info from [roadmap website](https://roadmap.sh/golang/orms)__

In Go, ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers) allow developers to interact with databases using Go objects, abstracting away SQL queries and enabling more idiomatic Go code. Here are some popular Go ORM libraries along with their use cases and key features.

## Popular Go ORM Libraries

| __ORM Library__ | __Description__ | __Key Features__ | __Use Cases__ |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|
| __GORM__        | The most popular Go ORM with rich features and community support. | Auto migrations, SQL builder, associations, transactions, hooks, preload, gRPC integrations | General-purpose ORM for large and small applications. |
| __SQLBoiler__   | A strict ORM that generates Go code from your database schema. | Auto-generated models, eager loading, automatic migrations | Projects that need compile-time checks, large DB-driven systems. |
| __Ent__         | Entity framework by Facebook, focuses on schema modeling and code generation. | Graph-based modeling, schema generation, advanced query API, supports SQL dialects (MySQL, Postgres, SQLite) | Complex data models with multiple relationships (e.g., social networks, recommendation systems). |
| __Xorm__        | Simple and lightweight ORM focused on performance and simplicity. | Struct to table mapping, caching, multi-database support, raw SQL execution | Projects that need fast database interactions with simple mapping. |
| __BeeGo ORM__   | An ORM that comes with the Beego framework, but can also be used standalone. | Multi-database support, struct models, query building | Medium-scale applications, especially within the Beego ecosystem. |
| __Reform__      | A type-safe ORM focusing on minimalism and performance. | Type-safe query building, simple schema management, no reflection | Performance-focused applications that need compile-time checks. |
| __GORMX__       | A GORM extension focused on multi-tenancy and distributed systems. | Multi-tenant support, global and local database configurations | SaaS platforms and systems needing tenant-aware database logic. |

### Summary

- __GORM__: Best for general-purpose ORM use, popular for many Go projects with complex relationships.
- __SQLBoiler__: For large, schema-driven projects requiring strict compile-time checks.
- __Ent__: For complex graph-based data models, commonly used in enterprise-level applications.
- __Xorm__: Lightweight and fast for projects with simple data requirements.
- __BeeGo ORM__: A good choice if you're using Beego or want an easy-to-use ORM with the framework.
- __Reform__: Type-safe, minimalistic ORM for performance-focused applications.
- __GORMX__: Ideal for SaaS applications needing multi-tenant support.

Each ORM has its unique use cases, and the right choice depends on your projectâ€™s complexity, performance needs, and scale.
