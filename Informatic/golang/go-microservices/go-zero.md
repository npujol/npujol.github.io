__Roadmap info from [roadmap website](https://roadmap.sh/golang/go-microservices/go-zero)__

## go-zero framework

go-zero is a web and rpc framework with lots of engineering best practices builtin. Itâ€™s born to ensure the stability of the busy services with resilience design, and has been serving sites with tens of millions users for years.

### Go-Zero__

- __Purpose__: Web and RPC services with integrated service discovery, concurrency control, and observability.
- __Key Features__: Concurrency control, built-in observability, and service governance.
- __Best For__: Web and RPC services focusing on scalability and performance.

   __Example__:

   ```go
   server := zrpc.MustNewServer(c.RpcServerConf, func(grpcServer *grpc.Server) {
       pb.RegisterGreeterServer(grpcServer, svc)
   })
   ```

### Go-Zero__ - High-Performance Web and RPC Services

   __Solution Example__: __High-Traffic Social Media Application__

- __Use Case__: A social media platform with features like user profiles, posts, likes, and comments requires high concurrency and low-latency responses.
- __Framework Usage__: With __Go-Zero__, web services like __ProfileService__ and __PostService__ handle high traffic efficiently, using built-in concurrency control and rate limiting to protect the system.
- __Workflow__:
     1. __ProfileService__ and __PostService__ handle millions of requests, leveraging __Go-Zero__'s built-in features for concurrency.
     2. Services can be scaled out to handle increasing loads without changing the codebase significantly.

   __Example__:

   ```go
   server := zrpc.MustNewServer(c.RpcServerConf, func(grpcServer *grpc.Server) {
       pb.RegisterProfileServer(grpcServer, svc)
   })
   ```
