## Go kit

Go kit is a programming toolkit for building microservices (or elegant monoliths) in Go. it solves common problems in distributed systems and application architecture so you can focus on delivering business value.

### Go-Kit__

- __Purpose__: Building reliable, large-scale microservices with observability.
- __Key Features__: Service discovery, logging, tracing, transport layers (HTTP, gRPC), middleware support.
- __Best For__: Large-scale, enterprise-grade microservice applications.

   __Example__:

   ```go
   svc := arithmeticService{}
   endpoint := makeAddEndpoint(svc)
   handler := httptransport.NewServer(endpoint, decodeAddRequest, encodeResponse)
   ```

### Go-Kit__ - Enterprise Microservice Platform

   __Solution Example__: __Banking System with Multiple Services__

- __Use Case__: A banking system that handles services like accounts, loans, payments, and transaction logging. Each service is independently deployed and monitored.
- __Framework Usage__: __Go-Kit__ provides observability, service discovery, logging, and tracing for each microservice (e.g., __AccountService__, __PaymentService__, __TransactionService__).
- __Workflow__:
     1. __AccountService__ registers with a service discovery mechanism.
     2. __PaymentService__ looks up the __AccountService__ when processing payments.
     3. All services log events and metrics for monitoring using Go-Kitâ€™s built-in observability tools.

   __Example__:

   ```go
   endpoint := makeAccountEndpoint(svc)
   handler := httptransport.NewServer(endpoint, decodeRequest, encodeResponse)
   http.ListenAndServe(":8080", handler)
   ```
