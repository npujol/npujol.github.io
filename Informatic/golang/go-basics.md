## Learn the Basics

Learn the common concepts of Go like variables, loops, conditional statements, functions, data types, and so on. A good starting point for go basics is its Goâ€™s official docs.

## Formatting Verbs for Printf()

Go offers several formatting verbs that can be used with the `Printf()` function.
General Formatting Verbs. The following verbs can be used with the integer data type:

| `%04d` | Pad with zeroes (width 4)                  |

## String Formatting Verbs

The following verbs can be used with the string data type:

| Verb   | Description                                                 |

| `%g`    | Exponent as needed, only necessary digits |

### Memory Efficiency

When using slices, Go loads all the underlying elements into the memory.
If the array is large and you need only a few elements, it is better to copy those elements using the __copy() function__. The __copy() function__ creates a new underlying array with only the required elements for the slice. This will reduce the memory used for the program.

```go
package main

import (
 "fmt"
)

func main() {
 // Suppose we have a large array
 largeArray := [1000000]int{}
 for i := 0; i < len(largeArray); i++ {
  largeArray[i] = i
 }

 // We only need a small slice of this large array
 smallSlice := largeArray[100:200]

 // This smallSlice still references the entire largeArray in memory
 fmt.Println("Length of smallSlice:", len(smallSlice))
 fmt.Println("Capacity of smallSlice:", cap(smallSlice)) // Large capacity indicates underlying array is still large

 // To optimize memory, create a new slice with a new underlying array using copy
 optimizedSlice := make([]int, len(smallSlice))
 copy(optimizedSlice, smallSlice)

 // Now, optimizedSlice is independent of largeArray and uses less memory
 fmt.Println("Length of optimizedSlice:", len(optimizedSlice))
 fmt.Println("Capacity of optimizedSlice:", cap(optimizedSlice)) // Capacity now matches the length, indicating efficient memory usage
}
```

### Defer

Go's defer statement schedules a function call (the deferred function) to be run immediately before the function executing the defer returns. It's an unusual but effective way to deal with situations such as resources that must be released regardless of which path a function takes to return. The canonical examples are unlocking a mutex or closing a file.

## Interfaces

- An interface type is defined as a set of method signatures.
- A value of interface type can hold any value that implements those methods.
