## Learn the Basics

Learn the common concepts of Go like variables, loops, conditional statements, functions, data types, and so on. A good starting point for go basics is its Goâ€™s official docs.

Visit the following resources to learn more:

## What is Go

- Go is a cross-platform, open source programming language
- Go can be used to create high-performance applications
- Go is a fast, statically typed, compiled language known for its simplicity and efficiency
- Go was developed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson in 2007
- Go's syntax is similar to C++

## What is Go Used For

- Web development (server-side)
- Developing network-based programs
- Developing cross-platform enterprise applications
- Cloud-native development

## Why Use Go

- Go is fun and easy to learn
- Go has fast run time and compilation time
- Go supports concurrency
- Go has memory management
- Go works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)

## Go Syntax

A Go file consists of the following parts:

- Package declaration
- Import packages
- Functions
- Statements and expressions

## Difference Between var and :=

There are some small differences between the var var :=:
|var |`:=`|
|--|--|
|Can be used inside and outside of functions |Can only be used inside functions|
|Variable declaration and value assignment can be done separately |Variable declaration and value assignment cannot be done separately|

## Formatting Verbs for Printf()

Go offers several formatting verbs that can be used with the Printf() function.
General Formatting Verbs

The following verbs can be used with all data types:
|Verb |Description|
|--|--|
|`%v` |Prints the value in the default format|
|`%#v` |Prints the value in Go-syntax format|
|`%T` |Prints the type of the value|
|`%%` |Prints the `%` sign|

## Integer Formatting Verbs

The following verbs can be used with the integer data type:
|Verb |Description|
|---|--|
|`%b` |Base 2|
|`%d` |Base 10|
|`%+d` |Base 10 and always show sign|
|`%o` |Base 8|
|`%O` |Base 8, with leading 0o|
|`%x` |Base 16, lowercase|
|`%X` |Base 16, uppercase|
|`%#x` |Base 16, with leading 0x|
|`%4d` |Pad with spaces (width 4, right justified)|
|`%-4d` |Pad with spaces (width 4, left justified)|
|`%04d` |Pad with zeroes (width 4)|

## String Formatting Verbs

The following verbs can be used with the string data type:
| Verb |Description|
|--|--|
| `%s` |Prints the value as plain string|
| `%q` |Prints the value as a double-quoted string|
| `%8s` |Prints the value as plain string (width 8, right justified)|
| `%-8s` |Prints the value as plain string (width 8, left justified)|
| `%x` |Prints the value as hex dump of byte values|
| `% x` |Prints the value as hex dump with spaces|

## Boolean Formatting Verbs

The following verb can be used with the boolean data type:
| Verb |Description|
|---|---|
| `%t` |Value of the boolean operator in true or false format (same as using %v)|

## Float Formatting Verbs

The following verbs can be used with the float data type:
|Verb |Description|
|---|---|
|`%e` |Scientific notation with 'e' as exponent|
|`%f` |Decimal point, no exponent|
|`%.2f`|Default width, precision 2|
|`%6.2f` |Width 6, precision 2|
|`%g` |Exponent as needed, only necessary digits|

## Array vs Slice

- Slices are similar to arrays, but are more powerful and flexible.
- Like arrays, slices are also used to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable.
- However, unlike arrays, the length of a slice can grow and shrink as you see fit.

### Capacity vs length

- __len() function__ - returns the length of the slice (the number of elements in the slice)
- __cap() function__ - returns the capacity of the slice (the number of elements the slice can grow or shrink to)

### Memory Efficiency

When using slices, Go loads all the underlying elements into the memory.
If the array is large and you need only a few elements, it is better to copy those elements using the __copy() function__.
The __copy() function__ creates a new underlying array with only the required elements for the slice. This will reduce the memory used for the program.

## Functions

### Naming Rules for Go Functions

- A function name must start with a letter
- A function name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Function names are case-sensitive
- A function name cannot contain spaces
- If the function name consists of multiple words, techniques introduced for multi-word variable naming can be used

### Defer

Go's defer statement schedules a function call (the deferred function) to be run immediately before the function executing the defer returns. It's an unusual but effective way to deal with situations such as resources that must be released regardless of which path a function takes to return. The canonical examples are unlocking a mutex or closing a file.

## Interfaces

- An interface type is defined as a set of method signatures.
- A value of interface type can hold any value that implements those methods.
