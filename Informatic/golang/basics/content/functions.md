### Naming Rules for Go Functions

- A function name must start with a letter
- A function name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Function names are case-sensitive
- A function name cannot contain spaces
- If the function name consists of multiple words, techniques introduced for multi-word variable naming can be used

### Functions Best Practices

- **Keep functions small**: Each function should focus on a single task.
- **Use descriptive names**: Choose names that clearly convey the functionâ€™s purpose.
- **Limit parameters**: Use structs to group related parameters.
- **Document clearly**: Use comments to describe what each function does.
- **Handle errors**: Return errors and handle them appropriately.
- **Avoid side effects**: Functions should be predictable and not alter external state.
- **Prefer explicitness**: Make behavior clear and explicit.
- **Return early**: Simplify control flow by returning early.
