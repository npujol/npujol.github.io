## Go Variable Naming Rules

A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, price, carname, etc.).

Go variable naming rules:

- A variable name must start with a letter or an underscore character (_)
- A variable name cannot start with a digit
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
- There is no limit on the length of the variable name
- A variable name cannot contain spaces
- The variable name cannot be any Go keywords
