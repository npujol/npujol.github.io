### Naming Rules for Go Functions

- A function name must start with a letter
- A function name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Function names are case-sensitive
- A function name cannot contain spaces
- If the function name consists of multiple words, techniques introduced for multi-word variable naming can be used

### Functions Best Practices

- __Keep functions small__: Each function should focus on a single task.
- __Use descriptive names__: Choose names that clearly convey the functionâ€™s purpose.
- __Limit parameters__: Use structs to group related parameters.
- __Document clearly__: Use comments to describe what each function does.
- __Handle errors__: Return errors and handle them appropriately.
- __Avoid side effects__: Functions should be predictable and not alter external state.
- __Prefer explicitness__: Make behavior clear and explicit.
- __Return early__: Simplify control flow by returning early.
