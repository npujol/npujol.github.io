## Type Inference

Type inference gives go the capability to detect the type of a value without being explicitly indicated , hence the possibility to declare variables without providing its type at first

Visit the following resources to learn more:

- [@article@Go Variables: Type Inference](https://www.callicoder.com/golang-variables-zero-values-type-inference/#type-inference)
- [@official@Tour of Go: Type Inference](https://go.dev/tour/basics/14)

- `:=` syntax to declare a variable and let the compiler infer its type from the assigned value.
- `fmt.Printf("x is of type %T\n", x)` `%T` returns the type of the function.
