## IP Routing


IP Routing in Linux refers to the process of setting up routing tables and configuring network routes for networking interfaces within the Linux operating system. It is the kernel`s responsibility to handle this task which involves the selection of pathways for sending network packets across to their intended destinations on a network.


This task is carried out using various command-line tools and the networking configuration files. The principle command-line tool for network configuration in Linux used to be `ifconfig`, but it has now been mostly replaced by the `ip` command.


For example, to view the routing table in Linux, the following command is used:



```
$ ip route show

```

This command returns a list of all routes that are known to the kernel.
