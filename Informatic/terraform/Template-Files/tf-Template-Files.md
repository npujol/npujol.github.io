__Roadmap info from [roadmap website](<https://roadmap.sh/terraform/template> files@nFq-64JQoYAKjN9YkmOfO)__

Terraform template files are a powerful feature for creating customizable, reusable configuration snippets. These files, typically with a `.tftpl` extension, contain placeholders that can be filled with variables at runtime. Terraform uses the `templatefile` function to process these files, replacing variables with actual values. This approach is useful for generating configuration files, scripts, or any text-based content that needs to be parameterized. Template files enhance modularity and reduce repetition in Terraform configurations. Theyâ€™re commonly used for creating user data scripts for EC2 instances, generating complex JSON configurations, or preparing any text-based resource that requires dynamic content. The `templatefile` function reads the contents of a file and renders its template syntax with a given set of variables, allowing for dynamic and flexible resource configurations.
