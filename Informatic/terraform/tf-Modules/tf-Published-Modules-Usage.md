# Published Modules Usage

## Contents

__Roadmap info from [roadmap website](<https://roadmap.sh/terraform/published> modules usage@AAg_iFggkEZNL12-6nkgK)__

Using published modules in Terraform involves incorporating pre-built, often community-contributed modules into your infrastructure code. These modules are typically available through the Terraform Registry or other version control systems. They provide ready-made configurations for common infrastructure components, saving time and promoting best practices. To use a published module, you specify its source (usually a URL or registry path) and version in your Terraform configuration. You can then configure the module by passing input variables. Published modules can range from simple resource wrappers to complex, multi-resource configurations. They offer benefits like reduced development time, standardized implementations, and community-tested solutions. However, it’s important to review and understand any published module before using it in production environments to ensure it meets your specific requirements and security standards.
