__Roadmap info from [roadmap website](https://roadmap.sh/terraform/testing@ECcHo0KTDN27MuVTC-Fwy)__

Testing Terraform code involves multiple approaches to ensure reliability and correctness of infrastructure-as-code. This includes syntax validation, linting for best practices, unit testing of modules, integration testing to verify resource creation, plan testing to review expected changes, and compliance testing for organizational policies. Tools like TFLint and frameworks such as Terratest are commonly used. Automated testing in CI/CD pipelines helps catch errors early and maintain code quality. Mock providers can be employed for testing without affecting real infrastructure, while property-based testing explores different input combinations. Effective testing strategies balance thoroughness with practicality, considering factors like execution time and resource costs.
