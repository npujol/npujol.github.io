## What is Infrastructure as Code?

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice in DevOps and cloud computing that involves managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files, rather than through physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. This approach allows for version control, automation, and consistency in infrastructure deployment, making it easier to manage, scale, and replicate environments while reducing the risk of human error.

## What is Terraform?

Terraform is a powerful tool designed by HashiCorp that helps you set up, manage, and update infrastructure safely and efficiently across various cloud providers. Think of it as a way to define your cloud resources—like servers, storage, and networks—using a simple code format. This makes it easier to automate, share, and manage your infrastructure, ensuring that everything is consistent and can be quickly reproduced or modified as needed.
