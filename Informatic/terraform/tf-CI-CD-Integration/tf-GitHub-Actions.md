# GitHub Actions

## Contents

__Roadmap info from [roadmap website](<https://roadmap.sh/terraform/github> actions@weIlGqGN15U8BH1yE9moA)__

Using Terraform with GitHub Actions allows for automated infrastructure management as part of a GitHub-based CI/CD pipeline. This integration enables automatic planning, validation, and application of Terraform configurations when changes are pushed to a repository. Typical workflow steps include checking out code, setting up Terraform, initializing the working directory, and running Terraform commands like plan and apply. GitHub Actions can be configured to run Terraform in different environments, manage state files, and handle secrets securely. Itâ€™s important to configure appropriate permissions and use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data.
