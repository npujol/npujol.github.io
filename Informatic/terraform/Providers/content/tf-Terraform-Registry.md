# Terraform Registry

## Contents

__Roadmap info from [roadmap website](<https://roadmap.sh/terraform/terraform> registry@iIjUG_N_mQtLHG25v4-xg)__

The Terraform Registry is a centralized repository for discovering, sharing, and using Terraform modules and providers. It allows users to browse and download pre-built configurations, enabling quick integration of best practices. The registry supports versioning, ensuring consistent deployments, and includes detailed documentation for each module and provider. Users can also publish their own modules to the registry, facilitating community collaboration and reuse.
