# Project Initialization

## Contents

__Roadmap info from [roadmap website](<https://roadmap.sh/terraform/project> initialization@ZRVv9onD7KGz1cJLcsnwy)__

Project initialization in Terraform involves setting up the necessary configuration files and directory structure for managing infrastructure as code. The `terraform init` command is crucial in this process, as it initializes the working directory, downloads the required provider plugins, and sets up the backend configuration for storing state files. This command ensures that the project is correctly configured and ready for subsequent Terraform commands, laying the foundation for efficient and organized infrastructure management.
