## Terragrunt

Terragrunt is a thin wrapper for Terraform that provides extra tools for keeping your configurations DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself), working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote state. It helps in managing large-scale infrastructure by reducing code duplication and simplifying the management of multiple environments. Key features include the ability to keep Terraform code DRY by defining inputs and backend configurations centrally, execute Terraform commands on multiple modules at once, and manage remote state for each module automatically. Terragrunt also facilitates the use of Terraform modules across different environments by allowing for easy parameter injection. It’s particularly useful in complex, multi-environment setups where maintaining consistency and reducing repetition in Terraform configurations is crucial.
