# terraform fmt

## Contents

__Roadmap info from [roadmap website](<https://roadmap.sh/terraform/terraform> fmt@78bGm8J5Y1I8H4qioOvWb)__

terraform fmt is a command in Terraform that automatically formats configuration files to a consistent style. It adjusts indentation, aligns arguments, and sorts blocks and arguments alphabetically. The command rewrites Terraform configuration files (.tf and .tfvars) in the current directory and its subdirectories. Itâ€™s used to maintain a consistent coding style across projects and teams, improving readability and reducing merge conflicts. The command can be run with options like -recursive to format files in subdirectories, -diff to show the differences, or -check to validate formatting without making changes. Regularly using terraform fmt is considered a best practice in Terraform development workflows.
