# Variable Definition File

## Contents

__Roadmap info from [roadmap website](<https://roadmap.sh/terraform/variable> definition file@rdphcVd-Vq972y4H8CxIj)__

A Terraform `variables.tf` file centralizes input variable declarations for a module or configuration. It typically contains multiple variable blocks, each defining a single input variable with its name, type constraint, optional default value, and description. This file serves as a single reference point for all variables used in the configuration, enhancing readability and maintainability. While not mandatory, using `variables.tf` is a common practice to organize and document a moduleâ€™s expected inputs.
