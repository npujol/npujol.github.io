__Roadmap info from [roadmap website](<https://roadmap.sh/terraform/hashicorp> config. language (hcl)@BYydmFc2e-YPCC4MCWmh2)__

HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) is a configuration language built by HashiCorp that is used for configuring products in the HashiCorp ecosystem. With its human-readable style, HCL is designed to strike a balance between a generic configuration language like JSON or YAML and a high-level scripting language. In relation to the Terraform Roadmap, HCL is the primary language used for writing Terraform configuration files, thus making it a fundamental part of defining and providing data center infrastructure in a descriptive manner.
