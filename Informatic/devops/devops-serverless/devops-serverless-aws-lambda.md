## AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically scales, executes code in response to triggers, and charges only for the compute time consumed. Lambda supports multiple programming languages and integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, making it ideal for building microservices, automating tasks, and processing data streams with minimal operational overhead.
