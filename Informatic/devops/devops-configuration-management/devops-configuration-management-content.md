__Roadmap info from [roadmap website](https://roadmap.sh/devops/configuration-management@aQJaouIaxIJChM-40M3HQ)__

Automation can help enterprises reduce costs, complexity, and manual errors in a variety of IT use cases:

- **Infrastructure automation:** configure and manage server infrastructure to enforce consistency and eliminate configuration drift.
- **Cloud automation:** configure and manage cloud resources including operating systems, security groups, load balancers, and virtual private clouds. 
- **Network automation:** configure and manage network devices such routers and switches. 
- **Security automation:** configure and manage security devices such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems— and apply consistent network access policies. 
- **Edge automation:** configure and manage remote infrastructure systems including network, security, IoT devices, and server equipment.
## Comparison

- Ansible is known for its ease of use, agentless architecture, and declarative syntax.
- Chef is popular among DevOps practitioners who are comfortable with Ruby and the imperative syntax. It has a strong focus on infrastructure as code (IaC).
- Puppet is another popular choice among DevOps practitioners, offering a declarative syntax and a strong focus on IaC.

Ultimately, the choice between Ansible, Chef, or Puppet depends on your team's expertise, the complexity of your environment, and the specific needs of your configuration management use cases.
