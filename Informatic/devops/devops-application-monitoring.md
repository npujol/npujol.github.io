## Application Monitoring

Application monitoring involves the continuous observation and analysis of software applications to ensure they perform optimally, identify issues, and provide insights into their operation. This process includes tracking metrics such as response times, error rates, resource utilization (CPU, memory, and disk), and transaction performance. Application monitoring tools collect and analyze data to detect anomalies, provide alerts for potential problems, and offer detailed insights into application behavior and performance. By monitoring applications, organizations can proactively address issues, optimize performance, and improve user experience, ultimately ensuring reliability and efficiency in their software systems.

## Jaeger

Jaeger is an open-source, end-to-end distributed tracing system developed by Uber Technologies. It’s designed to monitor and troubleshoot microservices-based distributed systems. Jaeger helps to track requests as they flow through complex distributed systems, identifying performance bottlenecks and understanding system behavior. It supports OpenTracing standards, allowing for vendor-neutral instrumentation of applications. Jaeger features include distributed context propagation, dependency analysis, and root cause analysis. It offers a web UI for visualizing traces and a flexible architecture supporting various storage backends. Jaeger is particularly useful in cloud-native environments, helping developers and operators understand latency issues, optimize performance, and debug problems in microservices architectures.

## OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework for cloud-native software, providing a standardized way to collect and export telemetry data such as metrics, logs, and traces. It aims to make observability a built-in feature of cloud-native applications by offering a vendor-neutral, unified set of APIs, libraries, agents, and instrumentation. OpenTelemetry simplifies the implementation of observability across different languages and platforms, enabling developers to instrument their code once and send data to multiple backends. It supports automatic instrumentation for many popular frameworks and libraries, reducing the effort required to add observability to applications. By providing a consistent approach to data collection and export, OpenTelemetry facilitates better interoperability between observability tools and platforms in modern, distributed software environments.
