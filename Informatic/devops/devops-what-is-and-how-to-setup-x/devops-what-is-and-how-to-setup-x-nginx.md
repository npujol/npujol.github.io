## Nginx

NGINX is a high-performance, open-source web server, reverse proxy, and load balancer. Known for its efficiency in handling concurrent connections, NGINX uses an event-driven, asynchronous architecture that consumes minimal resources. It excels at serving static content, proxying requests to application servers, and load balancing across multiple backends. NGINX is widely used for its ability to improve website performance, scalability, and security. It supports various protocols including HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, and WebSocket, and offers features like SSL/TLS termination, caching, and content compression. Popular in both small-scale and enterprise environments, NGINX is a key component in many modern web architectures, particularly in microservices and containerized deployments.
